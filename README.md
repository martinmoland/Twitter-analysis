# About the project and repository
Codes related to forthcoming book chapter on public discourse regarding EU migration and COVID policies. Due to Twitter terms and services, as well as for research ethical reasons, I am unable to add data. However, I hope the codes can be useful for someone (like me) wanting to get started on automated text analysis using R.

## About the codes
The first part of the project is related to German-language Twitter discourses about the EU's handling of the refugee crisis. [This code](https://github.com/martinmoland/Twitter-analysis/blob/main/Github%20code.R) shows the R codes for running correlated topic models of the data.

## Tools and literature
The project relies heavily on [Quanteda](www.quanteda.io), a text-as-data package for R. I also rely on the structural topic modeling approach advanced by [Roberts et al. (2013)](https://scholar.princeton.edu/files/bstewart/files/stmnips2013.pdf).
